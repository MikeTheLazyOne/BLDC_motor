### Project Description

This project, created by MikeTheLazyOne, is my first attempt at controlling a motor. The code includes a PI controller with anti-windup, Park and DQ transformations, as well as scalar control. It should be noted that this implementation is a work in progress and requires further improvements for optimal performance.

### Features

1. PI Controller with Anti-Windup: The code includes a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller that incorporates anti-windup functionality. This feature helps prevent saturation and integrator windup, improving the stability and performance of the control system.

2. Park Transformation: The code also implements the Park transformation, which is commonly used in electrical engineering and power systems. This transformation converts the three-phase variables into a two-phase reference frame, simplifying control algorithms and analysis.

3. DQ Transformation: Additionally, the code incorporates the DQ transformation, another important tool in electrical engineering. This transformation converts the two-phase variables into a rotating reference frame, facilitating analysis and control of rotating machines.

4. Scalar Control: The code provides scalar control capabilities, allowing for simple and efficient control of various systems. Scalar control is a widely used method that operates on a single value or a scalar variable, making it versatile and easy to implement.
